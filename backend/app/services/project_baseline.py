"""U1: Baseline lock and execution-layer task/dependency instantiation.

`ProjectBaselineService.lock_and_instantiate` is the single service both
`POST /{project_id}/status` (draft->active branch) and
`POST /{project_id}/activate` must call, inside the same transaction as the
draft->active status flip, so no activation code path can produce an active
project without a locked baseline and instantiated tasks.

U8 adds external approvals to what activation instantiates, via
`ProjectApprovalInstantiationService` below. Activation is the one moment the
execution layer is allowed to read the planning layer, and it copies across
everything readiness will later need - coverage, blocking, prose - precisely
so readiness never has to go back for it (KTD8).
