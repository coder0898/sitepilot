"""U2: Task lifecycle state machine (BR-009).

`TaskLifecycleService.transition` is the single authority for moving a

transition table as an explicit allow-list (nothing inferred), gates
`ready`/`in_progress` on an active project Supervisor (BR-004) and on
predecessor-dependency satisfaction (BR-011/BR-008), auto-completes
successor milestones as a side effect, and writes a `V2AuditEvent` for every

        - `standard` work: satisfied once Supervisor-verified (a
          `task_verifications` row with decision='verified' and no later
          rejection exists) - it does not need to also reach `completed`,

          verify path immediately auto-completes it anyway, per U4's
          TaskVerificationService, so this task is nearly always observed
          at `completed`, not `verified` - but the `verified` case is
          the "satisfied" moment we should not block on regardless).
        - `class_a` work and `approval_gate`: require PM-approved
          `completed` (BR-008: "Verified class_a work requires PM approval
          before completion"; gates likewise complete only via PM
          approval).
        - `milestone`: requires `completed` (system-derived, BR-009).

        `start_to_start`: satisfied as soon as the predecessor has actually
        started, i.e. left the pre-start statuses. This is the whole point
        of the edge type - the successor is allowed to overlap the
        predecessor rather than queue behind it. Before this change
        `dependency_type` was stored and rendered but never read here, so
        every start-to-start edge silently behaved as finish-to-start and
        the parallel execution the template's SS edges exist to express
        never happened.

        `cancelled` satisfies either type: the work will not happen, so it
        can never become satisfied any other way, and leaving it
        unsatisfied strands every downstream task permanently with no
        recovery but cancelling them too.
