"""U4: Supervisor verification decisions (BR-008).

`TaskVerificationService.verify` records a `TaskVerification` decision
against a `work` task's most recent submitted progress update, then drives
`Task.lifecycle_status` forward (or back) via U2's `TaskLifecycleService`:

- `decision == 'verified'`: `submitted -> verified`; if the task is
  `standard` class, immediately also `verified -> completed` (standard
  work needs no PM step per BR-008). `class_a` work stops at `verified`,
  awaiting a later `TaskApprovalService.approve` call.
- `decision == 'rejected'`: `submitted -> rejected -> in_progress`, per
  BR-009's literal transition table - the task reopens under Supervisor
  accountability. A correction reason (`remarks`) is required.

`approval_gate` tasks never go through this service - BR-008 says gates
skip Supervisor verification entirely; they go straight to
`TaskApprovalService`.

Verifier resolution: the project's active Supervisor, or an audited PM/
Admin fallback (BR-007's "if a Supervisor is unavailable, the project PM
replaces or temporarily assigns the Supervisor" plus Admin's general
fallback authority). `TaskApprovalService` is responsible for refusing to
let that same fallback actor also record the task's approval decision.

Self-verification: no role rule authorizes the actor who submitted a
task's most recent progress update to also verify it - not even a
Supervisor who executed the task themselves because no Internal Employee
was assigned. Admin/Super Admin are exempt, matching their blanket
override elsewhere in this service.
