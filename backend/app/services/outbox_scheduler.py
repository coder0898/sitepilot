"""U3 (R18): drains the outbox on a schedule.

`OutboxService.emit` has written a pending `OutboxEvent` for every mutation
since Phase 2, and `MessageDispatchService.process_pending` has always known
how to deliver them - but nothing ever called it outside a test. The events
accumulated forever and no notification the system decided to send was ever
attempted.

This module is the missing caller and nothing more. It changes nothing about
what is emitted, nothing about who resolves as a recipient, and nothing about
where a message goes: the wired adapter is still `SandboxProviderAdapter` per
KTD7, which makes no network call and holds no credentials. Swapping in a
real provider is a separate and deliberate decision, and one worth making
carefully - the first real run would deliver the whole accumulated backlog at
once, for work that happened weeks ago.

Kept out of `main.py` so a pass and the loop's failure isolation can both be
tested directly, rather than by standing up an app and waiting on wall-clock
timers.
