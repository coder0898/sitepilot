"""Plan Phase 6 (second half): runs the daily task-prompt sweep and the
task-side escalation sweep in one pass, mirroring `outbox_scheduler.py`'s
shape exactly - see that module's docstring for the shape's own rationale.

Merged on purpose, not split into two files: the plan's own framing is that
the prompt sweep (`DailyTaskPromptsService`'s four `emit_*_checks` methods)
and the task-side escalation sweep
(`EscalationService.sweep_task_followups`/`sweep_task_escalations`) are the
same "what does this task need right now" pass over the same task set, so
one scheduler captures `now` once and threads that single instant through
every call in the pass rather than reading the clock fresh per call.
