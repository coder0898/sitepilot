"""Phase 2 U6: inbound WhatsApp message matching (R8/R9).

`InboundMessageService.process` is the single entry point called after
`backend/app/routes/whatsapp_webhook_v2.py` has already verified the
webhook's HMAC signature. Its job is strictly: (1) de-duplicate by
`provider_message_id`, (2) match `sender_phone` to exactly one known
identity (an active employee, via `users.phone` joined to an active
`EmployeeProfile`; or a vendor contact, via `V2VendorContact.phone` /
`.whatsapp`), (3) parse a minimal command grammar scoped to that identity's
allowed command set, and (4) translate an approved command into the EXACT
SAME service call a portal action of that kind would make -
`TaskLifecycleService.transition` for employees,
`VendorAcknowledgementService.record_acknowledgement` for vendor contacts.
This module never mutates `Task.lifecycle_status` or any vendor-assignment
state directly - it only ever calls into those two existing services, which
already own all role/access/state-machine checks.

No phone-number normalization is applied anywhere in this codebase yet
(see the plan's gap note) - matching is raw string equality against
whatever is stored in `users.phone` / `V2VendorContact.phone` /
`V2VendorContact.whatsapp`.

Command grammar (deliberately minimal - this is new entry-point wiring for
R8/R9's identity/signature/same-service-path guarantees, not a UX-polish
exercise; a real product would need a friendlier conversational UX):

    Whitespace-split the message body. The first token is the command
    keyword, matched case-insensitively. Everything else is positional.

    Vendor-contact identity only:
        ACCEPT <assignment_ref>
        DECLINE <assignment_ref>
        CLARIFY <assignment_ref> <note...>

    where <assignment_ref> is the first 8 hex characters of a
    `TaskVendorAssignment.id` UUID with dashes stripped (matched
    case-insensitively against every assignment's id in that same form -
    zero or more than one match is an error, never resolved by a
    "most recent" or similar heuristic). <note...> (CLARIFY only) is
    whatever text follows the ref, verbatim.

    Employee identity only:
        STATUS <task_code> <target_status>
        GATEACCEPT <approval_ref>
        GATEDECLINE <approval_ref>
        GATESTATUS <approval_ref> <health> [note...]
        GATEDECIDE <approval_ref> APPROVE|REJECT [reason...] (Admin/Super Admin only)

    where <task_code> is a `Task.original_code` (e.g. "T003" - unique only
    within a project, not globally) and <target_status> is passed through
    verbatim to `TaskLifecycleService.transition`, which validates it.
    <approval_ref> is the first 8 hex characters of a
    `ProjectExternalApproval.id` UUID with dashes stripped, matched the
    exact same way <assignment_ref> is above (zero or more than one match
    is an error). GATEACCEPT/GATEDECLINE call
    `ProjectGateAcknowledgementService.record` (U5) with response
    "accepted"/"declined" - that service owns its own assignee-only access
    check (`_require_assignee`), so no project-role gate is applied here.
    GATESTATUS (U7) calls the existing `ProjectGateStatusCheckService.record`
    unchanged, with <health> lower-cased before being passed through - that
    service is what actually validates it against `STATUS_CHECK_HEALTHS`
    and owns its own assignee-only access check, so nothing here duplicates
    either. <note...> (GATESTATUS only, optional) is whatever text follows
    <health>, verbatim - same convention as CLARIFY's trailing note above.

        GATEOPEN <approval_ref>
        GATECLOSE [note...]
        GATEDECIDE <approval_ref> APPROVE|REJECT [reason...]

    (U10) GATEOPEN calls `GateEvidenceSessionService.open_session` (U8),
    <approval_ref> resolved the same way GATEACCEPT/GATEDECLINE's is above.
    GATECLOSE takes no ref - the sender's one open session (KTD4's DB
    constraint) already identifies the gate; an optional trailing note is
    appended to that session before it is closed. Both delegate every
    access/state check to `GateEvidenceSessionService` itself.

    (U12) GATEDECIDE is the WhatsApp analogue of a portal Admin decision on
    a submitted gate - `ProjectGateDecisionService.decide` (already
    existing) unchanged. Unlike every other employee-identity gate command
    above, it is role-gated at THIS layer FIRST, before the ref is even
    resolved: only `UserRole.admin`/`UserRole.super_admin` may send it - any
    other employee (PM, Supervisor, Internal Employee) is rejected with
    "This command is not available for your role.", a wording deliberately
    distinct from BR-015's cross-identity "not available for your identity
    type" below, so the two rejection reasons stay distinguishable in
    `InboundMessage.rejection_reason`. This role gate is a WhatsApp-layer
    pre-check for that distinguishable reason, not a substitute for
    `decide`'s own Admin-only `_require_approver` - the service's check is
    left in place unchanged. `APPROVE`/`REJECT` (case-insensitive) map to
    `decide`'s own `"approved"`/`"rejected"` decision values; anything after
    them is the optional `reason`, verbatim - same trailing-text convention
    as CLARIFY's/GATESTATUS's/GATECLOSE's own note.

    Any OTHER inbound message from an employee - free text with no
    recognized keyword, or an attachment (U9's media metadata: `id`,
    `mime_type`, `filename`, no bytes yet) - is routed into the sender's
    currently open evidence session instead of being rejected as
    "Unrecognized command", provided one is open (a genuinely empty message
    - no text AND no attachment, e.g. a location pin - is still
    "Unrecognized command" unconditionally). Plain text appends verbatim via
    `append_text`. An attachment is checked against
    `ALLOWED_EVIDENCE_MIME_TYPES` first (a miss is rejected without ever
    calling `download_inbound_media`); only a supported mime_type is
    downloaded, then checked against `MAX_EVIDENCE_SIZE_BYTES` (KTD18 - the
    same cap `project_gate_submission.py` enforces on the portal path)
    before being written to storage as a `FileObject` and linked via
    `append_attachment`. An employee with NO open session gets a distinct
    "no open session - send GATEOPEN first" rejection, checked before the
    mime_type check even runs - see `_handle_gate_session_fallback`/
    `_handle_gate_attachment` below for the exact ordering and the three
    distinct rejection reasons (unsupported type / download failure /
    oversized).

    A vendor contact sending STATUS/GATEACCEPT/GATEDECLINE/GATESTATUS/
    GATEOPEN/GATECLOSE/GATEDECIDE, or an employee sending
    ACCEPT/DECLINE/CLARIFY, is rejected as "not available for your identity
    type" (BR-015). An unrecognized keyword is rejected as "Unrecognized
    command."

Actor substitution for vendor acknowledgements (the one genuinely
non-obvious design decision here): `VendorAcknowledgementService.
record_acknowledgement` requires a `User` actor because it runs its own
PM-only access check (`_require_pm`) - but a `V2VendorContact` has no
`User` row at all in this codebase (no `user_id` FK). R4 already
establishes that a PM records an acknowledgement "on the vendor's behalf";
R9 says this unit must produce "the identical record a PM's portal
acknowledgement would produce" for an approved vendor reply. Combining
those: the correct actor to pass is the project's currently active PM's
`User` (resolved via `V2ProjectMembership` for the assignment's project,
`project_role == 'project_manager'`, `ends_at IS NULL`, then that
membership's `EmployeeProfile.user_id`). This satisfies
`record_acknowledgement`'s own access check exactly as a real PM-driven
portal call would, while the `inbound_messages` row itself still records
the vendor contact as the identity that actually sent the message - the
PM substitution is purely an actor-parameter mechanic for the downstream
service call, never surfaced as who "did" the acknowledgement in this
table. If no active PM exists for the project, that is a `'rejected'`
outcome, not a crash - there is no one to record on the vendor's behalf.
