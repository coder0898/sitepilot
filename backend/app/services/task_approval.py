"""U4: PM approval decisions (BR-008).

`TaskApprovalService.approve` records a `TaskApprovalDecision` against a
task and drives `Task.lifecycle_status` forward (or back) via U2's
`TaskLifecycleService`:

- `class_a` work: requires the task to currently be `verified` (i.e. a
  prior `TaskVerificationService.verify` call with `decision == 'verified'`
  and no later rejection - checked explicitly against `TaskVerification`,
  not just trusting `lifecycle_status`). On approve: `verified ->
  approval_pending -> completed`. `verification_id` on the recorded
  decision is populated from that verification.
- `approval_gate`: no verification prerequisite - `approval_gate` tasks
  skip Supervisor verification entirely per BR-008. Requires the task to
  currently be `submitted`. On approve: `submitted -> approval_pending ->
  completed`. `verification_id` is null.
- `rejected` (either kind): requires a correction reason (`remarks`) and
  transitions the task back to `in_progress`, per BR-009's literal
  transition table (`verified -> approval_pending` is never entered on
  rejection; BR-009 also allows a direct `submitted -> approval_pending`
  or `verified -> approval_pending` before landing on `rejected` - this
  service transitions straight to `approval_pending` then `rejected` so
  the intermediate state is recorded, matching the same two-step shape
  used for `verified -> approval_pending -> completed`).

Same-actor restriction (BR-008's "the fallback verifier may not also be
the approver of record for the same decision cycle"): if the most recent
`TaskVerification` for this task was recorded by a PM acting as a
fallback verifier (i.e. the verifying user is not the project's active
Supervisor), that same user may not also record this task's approval
decision - a different authorized actor (a different PM, or Admin/Super
Admin) must approve.
