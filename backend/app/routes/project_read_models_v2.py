"""Collection-level read models for the Projects split view.

IMPORTANT: this router must be registered BEFORE `projects_v2.router` in
app.main. Both live under `/api/v2/projects`, and projects_v2 defines
`GET /{project_id}` - FastAPI matches in registration order, so the
catch-all would otherwise swallow `/summaries` and `/attention` and reject
them as malformed UUIDs. `test_project_read_models_v2.py` pins this.

Access is per-actor, not Admin-only: a PM or Supervisor gets the same
shapes narrowed to the projects they are actually a member of, which is
what makes the list pane and the attention counter usable for them.
